# Spaghetty
A Launchy plugin which stores and retrieves copy pasta

## Installation
Works with [Launchy](http://www.launchy.net) v2.5.0, possibly other versions. Requires [Launchy#](http://launchysharp.sourceforge.net/).

To install, copy the contents of the **plugins** directory (`SpaghettyPlugin.dll` and `icons`) into your **Launchy\plugins** directory. You probably have an `icons` dir already and this will put the Spaghetty icon in there.

## Usage
### Creating a new pasta
Using the `Spaghetty` command, type a name for your pasta. It should appear as `New pasta 'whatever you typed'`. Launching this will bring up a window with a blank text area. Paste the thing in there and hit Save.

### Retrieving an existing pasta
Using the `Spaghetty` command, type the name of a pasta. It'll autocomplete the name, and launching it will pop up a window with the pasta highlighted. You can copy it from there, or edit it and save.
